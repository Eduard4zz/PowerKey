### Key Options
Choose from one of the following power key replacements.

 - Delete
 - Page Up
 - Page Down
 - Home
 - End
 - Escape
 - Tab

If you have an idea for a replacement key that should be included, [file a github issue](https://github.com/pkamb/PowerKey/issues).

### Download

[Download PowerKey](https://github.com/pkamb/PowerKey/releases)

### What if I need to press the power key?
You can still prompt the system **[Restart | Sleep | Cancel | Shut Down]** pop-up by pressing `Fn + Power`. This app does not change the power key's function when modifier keys are held.

### But my Macbook has an Eject key!
Right! Eject has been replaced by Power on the newer Macbook Pro and Macbook Air models.

Your laptop's Power *button* will actually work with this app, but it's up to you if that's desireable.
