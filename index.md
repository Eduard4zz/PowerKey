###Important!
Your computer will still shut down if you *hold* the power key. Be careful!

### Key Options
Choose from one of the following power key replacements.

 - Delete
 - Page Up
 - Page Down
 - Home
 - End
 - Escape
 - Tab

If you have an idea for a replacement key that should be included, [file a github issue](https://github.com/pkamb/PowerKey/issues).

### What if I need to press the power key?
You can still prompt the system `[Restart | Sleep | Cancel | Shut Down]` pop-up by pressing `Fn + Power`. This app does not change the power key's function when modifier keys are held.
