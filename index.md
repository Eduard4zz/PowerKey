### Remap your Macbook's power key
Macbook Pro and Macbook Air do not have a Forward Delete key. But they *do* have a power key in the top-right corner. Let's remap it to something useful.

###Important!
Your computer will still shut down if you *hold* the power key. Be careful!

### Key Options
Choose from one of the following Power key replacements.

 - Delete
 - Page Up
 - Page Down
 - Home
 - End
 - Escape
 - Tab

### What if I need to press the power key?
You can still prompt the system `[Restart | Sleep | Cancel | Shut Down]` pop-up by pressing `Fn + Power`. This app does not change the power key's function when modifier keys are held.
